# Weather Travel Analysis

## Project Overview

In this module, we retriev and analyze weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. 

## Resources
- Data Source: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CityPy, Python Request, APIs, JSON Traversals

## Challenge Overview
For the new modifications to the PlanMyTrip app, we will add more data to the database, or cities DataFrame, for customers to know the weather in the cities. Additionally, the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours were added so that customers can filter the DataFrame. As a final task, we added a direction layer in Google maps that shows the directions between multiple cities for travel.

## Summary

### Part 1

Get the Weather Description and Amount of Precipitation for Each City
We generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes.
Got the nearest city using the citipy module.
Performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.
Retrieved the following information from the API call:

- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Weather description (e.g., clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)
- Using a try-except block, if it is raining, get the amount of rainfall in inches for the last three hours. If it is not raining, add 0 inches for the city.
- Using a try-except block, if it is snowing, get the amount of snow in inches for the last three hours. If it is not snowing, add 0 inches for the city. Added the data to a new DataFrame.
- Our new DataFrame looks similar to the following image:

### Part 2

Have Customers Narrow Their Travel Searches Based on Temperature and Precipitation

Imported the WeatherPy_vacation.csv file from Part 1 as a new DataFrame. Filter the DataFrame for minimum and maximum temperature preferences, and if the rain or snow accumulation is 0 inches or not using conditional statements. Doing the following:

- Prompt the customer for the minimum temperature preference.
- Prompt the customer for the maximum temperature preference.
- Prompt the customer to answer if he or she would like it to be raining or not, using input("Do you want it to be raining? (yes/no) ").
- Prompt the customer to answer if he or she would like it to be snowing or not, using input("Do you want it to be snowing? (yes/no) ").
- Our new hotel DataFrame looks similar to the following image:

From the filtered DataFrame we added the cities to a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city that includes:

- Hotel name
- City
- Country
- Current weather description with the maximum temperature

### Part 3

Create a Travel Itinerary with a Corresponding Map
We created a map (travel itinerary) that shows the route between four cities from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations, and then created a map with pop-up markers for the four cities, by:

Importing the WeatherPy_vacation.csv file as a new DataFrame. From the vacation search map, we chose four cities in close proximity on our map that are on the same continent that a customer might travel to, and then created a directions layer map.

We Filtered the DataFrame for each city we wanted to go to and created separate DataFrames for each city.
Used the directions Layer instructions from the gmaps documentation
Use the list indexing and Pandas methods to get the latitude-longitude pairs for each city DataFrame as tuples.
